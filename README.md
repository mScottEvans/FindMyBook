### Cooperative

- Make a list of each person’s strengths:
Scott: GitFlow and CSS.

Andrew: front-end/rendering

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

We will try to lean on our strengths and also allow space to learn other areas where we want to grow.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Scott: Bootstrap, back-end integration.

Andrew: back-end functionality like caching, then/promise, try/catch, error handling

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

Take turns driving and navigating, lots of comments and clarity in the code, the more we’re able to discuss/code together the more we’ll both understand the code, start with the easy/strength parts first and move to harder/learning/weakness parts after.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Communicate amongst the team, especially by doing a stand-up. Repeat as needed. If communication isn’t resulting in changes or communication is breaking down, possible reach out to instructor.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

Communicate amongst the team, especially by doing a stand-up. Repeat as needed. If communication isn’t resulting in changes or communication is breaking down, possible reach out to instructor.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Be open about what you understand and what you don’t. Don’t let different levels of skill get in the way of the project – use it as an asset. Don’t dwell on the thing you don’t understand, use it as a learning opportunity to be a better developer.
